    + not open source
    + less powerful than unix
    + license fees
  + Linux = Minix + Unix
  + GNU GPL

* terminal basics
OS interacts with user via shell - TUI.

+ ~whoami~ displays username
+ ~hostname~ displays system name
+ ~uname~ collects system info, flag ~-a~ for full info
+ ~who~ shows info abt all registered users
+ ~echo~ displays string passed to it

+ ~/~ for entering search pattern
  + ~n N~ for navigation

+ ~date timedatectl date +%s~

* environment variables & aliases
- environment variable :: text variable with some info
  + shell variables :: only current instance
  + environment variables :: all instances all the time

~printenv~ show all envvars

~$~ dereference symbol to gain access to the variable's text.

all user created vars via ~NAME="TEXT"~ are *shell variables*

to create environment variable
#+begin_src bash
echo "export NAME=VALUE" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
#+end_src
