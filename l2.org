* history of filesystems
- pubched cards
  + you needed a lot of them
  + reading was not that fast
- IBM -- first prototype of hard disk
  + disk files
  + processors registers combined into single register file
- introduction to file systems
  + when there are multiple "virtual memory devices" in single
    memory
  + this is when /file/ got its modern meaning
  + filenames consisted of 2 parts:
    - main name :: modern file name
    - supplementary name :: modern file extension
  + combine files into structures
    - first it was a simple array, linked to memory device
    - today most common is a tree structure with ability to mount
      and insert additional nodes and subtrees(links)
    - filename now is a path to the file in such structure -
      enumeration of tree nodes which needed to be passed to access file

* file system definition
+ File :: is a named memory segment on data device which
  given to the user as a whole
+ filename :: a string contains for file identification
+ filesystem :: part of the os that defines a way for organization,
  storage and labeling on data devices in computer

* file hierarchy
+ FHS
  - ~/~ :: root directory
  - ~/bin~ :: common programs that can be used ny superusers and
   default users, but needed when other filesystems are not
   mounted
  - ~/dev~ :: devices files
  - ~/etc~ :: config files
  - ~/home~ :: home directories for common users
  - ~/lib~ :: libraries for programs from ~/bin~ and ~/sbin~ and
    kernel modules
  - ~/media~ :: mounting points for external memory devices
  - ~/mnt~ :: mounting points for temporary mounting
  - ~/opt~ :: additional software
  - ~/proc~ :: pseudofilesystem, shows kernel state and launched processes
  - ~/root~ :: home directory
  - ~/run~ :: pseudofilesystem, shows data linked with launched processes
  - ~/sbin~ :: system binaries only for superuser
  - ~/srv~ :: data for system services
  - ~/sys~ :: pseudofilesystem that shows devices and drivers
  - ~/tmp~ :: temporary files
  - ~/usr~ :: secondary hierarchy
  - ~/var~ :: changeable files ~/var/tmp~ - temp files that saved after reload
